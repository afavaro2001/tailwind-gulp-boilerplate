This is a simple boilerplate that combines Tailwind 4 and GULP support for SASS, CSS and Javascript development.

After installing the project, open a prompt on root directory and run the following commands:

1) npm install

2) npm run start

Edit SASS, CSS and JavaScript file in the proper folders within ./assets/src directory. Output for SASS in ./assets/dist/css/main.min.css and output for CSS in ./assets/dist/css/atyles.min.css. Output for JavaScript in ./assets/dist/js/scripts.min.js.

Enjoy! :)
